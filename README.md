NetSuite SuiteTalk Client Library for .NET
==========================================

PLEASE NOTE: This repo is no longer maintained. See below:

# We have moved on to .NET Core

This library is now being maintained by Celigo's CloudExtend team in their GitHub account at:
[lib-netsuite-servicemgr](https://github.com/cloudextend/contrib-netsuite-servicemgr)

Please note that, lib-netsuite-servicemgr has evolved independantly of this library. It is only compliant with .NET core framework and is not a drop in replacement for this library due to changes in interfaces.
